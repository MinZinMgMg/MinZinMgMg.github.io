    <h3>IT Services</h3>
    
    <p>IT services refers to the application of business and technical expertise to enable organizations in the creation, management and optimization of or access to information and business processes.

        The IT services market can be segmented by the type of skills that are employed to deliver the service (design, build, run). There are also different categories of service: business process services, application services and infrastructure services.
        
        If these services are outsourced, they are referred to as business process outsourcing (BPO), applications outsourcing (AO) and infrastructure outsourcing.
